    <h3>Thesis Statement</h3>
    <p>Designing experiences for virtual reality (VR), just like any other type of design, still involves the fundamental aspect of
standardization, which makes interfaces familiar and usable amongst users. Just how the dropdown is a universal web
element, that lets users select an option for multiple options, there are very few established design patterns for VR. This is
especially true for narrative experiences, experiences similar to those created by media publications, similar to a guided
narrated video or story telling experience. Core functions like selecting scenes in a menu, pausing and playing, and selecting
choices for feedback are either varied causing disconnected experiences or non-existent. My project will explore these
necessary interactions which many of these experiences share in order to investigate how best to accommodate the userâ€™s
needs when using the application.
